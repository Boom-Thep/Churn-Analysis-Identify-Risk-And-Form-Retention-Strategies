# Churn Insights & Revenue Impact: Understanding Customer Attrition in Telecom Company
## Project Summary
This project presents a customer churn dataset from a telecom company specializing in phone and internet services. The dataset covers the Q3 churn report, consisting of 7,043 customers from California. The goal of this project is to analyze churn patterns, identify key risk factors, and measure the financial impact of customer attrition.
We are collaborating with the customer experience and retention teams to assess churn drivers and develop strategies to minimize churn. By analyzing historical data, we aim to understand which customer segments are most at risk and how to improve retention through targeted actions.
The KPIs we are investigating include:
- **Churn Rate** – The percentage of customers who left during the period.
- **Revenue Lost Due to Churn** – The total revenue lost from churned customers.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Segmentation** – Categorizing customers into High, Medium, and Low Value segments to assess financial impact.
- **Churn by Customer Segments** – Identifying which groups churn the most (e.g., contract type, tenure, service type).
- **Average Tenure of Churned Customers** – Understanding whether early-stage customers are more likely to churn.
- **Monthly Charges vs. Churn** – Determining if pricing influences churn behavior.
- **Satisfaction Score & Churn** – Evaluating how customer satisfaction affects churn risk.
  
Insights and recommendations from this analysis will be used by the customer retention and strategy teams to develop personalized retention offers, improve pricing models, and enhance customer service efforts to minimize churn and maximize revenue retention.

## About Data

## Insight Deep Dive
### Overall Business Performance
- **Customer Total:** The company currently serves **7,043 customers**, meaning this dataset represents the entire active customer base for the period analyzed.
- **Total Revenue ($21.37M):** This is the total revenue earned from all customers during the analyzed period. A high revenue figure suggests a strong market presence, but churn can significantly impact future earnings.
- **Total CLTV ($30.99M):** The total estimated future value of the customer base is significant. This suggests that if all customers were retained, they would contribute nearly **$31M over their lifetime**.
- **Churn Rate (27%):** A **27% churn rate is quite high** for a telecom company. It means **more than 1 in 4 customers left**, which could indicate customer dissatisfaction, competitive pressure, or pricing issues.
- **Total Lost Revenue ($3.68M):** The company **lost $3.68** in revenue due to customer churn. This is **17.2% of total revenue**, showing that churn is causing a significant financial impact.
- **Total Lost CLTV ($7.75M):** The long-term value of lost customers is **$7.75M**, which is even more concerning. This shows that churned customers could have contributed much more revenue over time if retained.

### CLTV Segmentation
- **High-Value Customers:** The company were able to **retain a total of 1891 High-Value customers**, which is a positive sign. However, **555 High-Value customers churned**. This is a significant concern as these customers are the most profitable, so losing them has a major financial impact. In addition, only **128 high value customers joined**, which is a concern because acquiring high-value customers is crucial for revenue growth. 
- **Medium-Value Customers:** Medium value customers have the **highest retention at 2,515 customers**, but also had the **highest churn at 1,108 customers**, showing mixed loyalty. Moreover, medium value customers make up the bulk of **new customers at 274 customers**.
- **Low-Value Customers:** Low value customers have the **lowest retention at 314 customers** and the **lowest churn at 206 customers**, indicating a smaller financial impact. Moreover, Low-Value customers make up the smallest portion of **new customers at 52 customers**, suggesting that the company is not heavily attracting or focusing on this segment.

### CLTV Segmentation by Age Group
- 36-50 and 20-35 age groups have the highest number of customers across all CLTV segments, indicating they are the core customer base.
- 51-65 and Over 65 groups have fewer customers, but their churn numbers are relatively high, suggesting retention challenges among older users.
- Under 20 group has the smallest customer base (only 34 High-Value and 12 Medium-Value customers), likely due to less spending power or lower service needs.
- Medium-Value customers have the highest churn in every age group, showing that this segment is the most unstable regardless of age
