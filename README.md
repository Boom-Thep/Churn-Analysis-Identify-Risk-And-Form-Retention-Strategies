# Churn Insights & Revenue Impact: Understanding Customer Attrition in Telecom Company
## Project Summary
This project presents a customer churn dataset from a telecom company specializing in phone and internet services. The dataset covers the Q3 churn report, consisting of 7,043 customers from California. The goal of this project is to analyze churn patterns, identify key risk factors, and measure the financial impact of customer attrition.
We are collaborating with the customer experience and retention teams to assess churn drivers and develop strategies to minimize churn. By analyzing historical data, we aim to understand which customer segments are most at risk and how to improve retention through targeted actions.
The KPIs we are investigating include:
- Churn Rate – The percentage of customers who left during the period.
- Revenue Lost Due to Churn – The total revenue lost from churned customers.
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Segmentation – Categorizing customers into High, Medium, and Low Value segments to assess financial impact.
- Churn by Customer Segments – Identifying which groups churn the most (e.g., contract type, tenure, service type).
- Average Tenure of Churned Customers – Understanding whether early-stage customers are more likely to churn.
- Monthly Charges vs. Churn – Determining if pricing influences churn behavior.
- Satisfaction Score & Churn – Evaluating how customer satisfaction affects churn risk.
  
Insights and recommendations from this analysis will be used by the customer retention and strategy teams to develop personalized retention offers, improve pricing models, and enhance customer service efforts to minimize churn and maximize revenue retention.
